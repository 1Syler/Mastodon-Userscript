# Mastodon-Userscript

To use this script you need to install the Tampermonkey browser extension https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Once you have installed Tampermonkey open the script https://github.com/1Syler/Mastodon-Userscript/raw/main/functions.user.js
and Tampermonkey will prompt you to install it

Before you use the script if you are not on the **twit.social** server you will need to change this line in the code to your server.

**const myServer = "twit.social";** On line 112

The script add two functions. The first one adds a new button to remote profiles, which when clicked will take you to the profile on your own server. This avoids having to copy the user handle then do a search to find the profile

The second function adds a button to your profile page that allows you to filter your followers for any you haven't followed back.
